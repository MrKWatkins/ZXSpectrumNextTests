# ZXSpectrumNextTests
[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/MrKWatkins/ZXSpectrumNextTests.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/MrKWatkins/ZXSpectrumNextTests)

Simple test programs for the ZX Spectrum Next. The programs here are designed to highlight certain behaviours of the Next hardware so emulator authors can test against real hardware. Also FPGA authors can change the core and make sure it still shows the desired behaviour.
