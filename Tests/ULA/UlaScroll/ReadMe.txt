This tests the X/Y offset of ULA.

There is 16x16 dithered grid printed (just to have something on screen) and
offset registers are animated from [-233,165] to [0,0] in 512 steps (~10s).

After the animation is finished, the border will turn green, and the test
will become interactive (OPQA to scroll).
