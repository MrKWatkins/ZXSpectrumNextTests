--- programming notes (just archiving them)

Visual design - base is the LoRes mixing test:

Legend sprite + layer2 + ulaLoRes - move to RIGHT.
MachineID + core version = move to top-left, ahead of the legend boxes
Put "PRESS I O P" (letters under particular legend box) (1 or 2 lines?)

The actual mixing will happen at char lines 6..9 and 12..15 - two empty lines between
(maybe a bit more down, as the new "PRESS" idea happened)

Left is legend with expected result, next to it is real result box

8x8 Layer2 - pixels needed for colour mixing
4x4 LoRes - pixels needed for colour mixing

----  ||||      4 intensities of one base colour
----  ||||
----  ||||
----  ||||

base colour options: rotate (11101000) -> 000, 100, 010, 101, 110, 111, 011, 001
increments from 0 to 7 does cover them too, but rotating is more fun, right?

Two new mixing modes: S L+U, S L+U

Pick LoRes for ULA -> allows for non-hackish pixels using different colours

%110 = S (L+U)
%111 = S (L+U-5)

transparent = other layer displayed unchanged
if L2p => final colour is "priority" too

Palette needed:
black, white, b_white, t_white, text, d_text, Tpink, TpinkP     ; 8
sprite, layer2, ula    ; legend + expected ; 11
 ; expected result will display U+L as 1x1 L2 dither!
l2_0, l2_1, l2_2, l2_3  ; 15
u_0, u_1, u_2, u_3  ; 19

intesity of 4: 7531 ; for 0 use base colour black

combinations:

Sprites: {ss, sT, sX}
Layer2: {ll, pp, lT, pT}
ULA: {uu, uT}
= 24 combinations (and then after that the clamping has to exercised)

Clamping L+U:
0+anything = anything
a+b <= 7 = no clamping
a+b > 7 = clamp to 7
7+7 ]= 7 (max case)

Clamping L+U-5:
0+0-5 ]= 0 (min case)
0+0..4-5 ]= 0 clamp to 0
0+5-5 = 0
5+anything-5 = anything
6..7 + b - 5 <= 7 = no clamping
6..7 + b - 5 > 7 ]= 7 clamp to 7
7+7-5 ]= 7 (max case)
