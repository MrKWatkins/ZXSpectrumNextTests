This is similar test to "Layer2Colours" test, but the ULA layer is switched to "HiRes"
mode this time. Following text is same as Layer2Colours (if you read it already...).

Another "twist" is, that the ULA graphics for tests is not simple "cyan + transparent
strips", but there're 2+2 lines between full/empty strip sporting chequered pattern to
exercise the half-width-pixel combining with full-width pixels of Sprites/Layer2.

The border colour is overriden by HiRes port $FF configuration, to be the same as paper.
The ink+paper attribute generated by ULA from HiRes config is %01010101 (bright 1, ink 5,
paper 2), and with ULANext INK-mask set to 7 this will decompose into Ink 5 and
Paper 128+10 = 138, so the ULA palette0 item 138 is used for both paper and border.
There's transparent-pink colour set on that item, making the both ULA paper and border
"transparent", and displaying instead the "transparency fallback" colour (which is set
to "pink" in this test any way, so pink turns to pink) (The palette item 5 is used
for ink, which is set to bright cyan).

EDIT: with core2.00.25 the border colour is either index [130] or [2], i.e. paper colour
without bright bit... So this is still work-in-progress and to be confirmed by core
devs later, what is the final "correct" behaviour.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Draws all three basic layers (Sprite, Layer2, ULA-HiRes) in all combinations affecting
priority and transparency, and in all basic six layer-order modes.

There's 24 total combinations (of course many yield same result, but hidden layers are
in different state), there's table at bottom of this txt showing all combinations.

So the TEST-area for particular layer ordering is on the right end in 6x4 (24) characters
area (one character = 8x8 pix). This output is composed from all the layers, and its
result shows the actual emulator/board rendering result.

At left side of screen there is label noting the layers-order, and scaled-down expected
result (this is drawn as Layer2 graphics, i.e. not mixed from real layer data).

In the middle there are three areas showing how each layer is set (Sprite, Layer2, ULA),
these are again drawn in Layer2 graphics (not drawn by layer which they depict).
(these middle areas are only shown once, as they remain identical for all layer orderings)

The 2x2 chequered white/grey areas represent where transparent colour is in graphics.

The 1x1 chequered black/white areas in sprites depict none-sprite situation.

The Layer2 right half of graphics is shown "brighter", and the green and transparent
colours used for that half have both the priority bit set to 1 (yes, the L2 palette has
two colours set as "pink" for transparency, one with and one without priority bit, and
both are used in the test-area, now how amazing is that?!).

The Sprite pattern has extra black-dotted "something" resembling rectangle "inside" (with
extra corners), this is to give visual aid about single sprite size (16x16 pixels), and
it intentionally spans also over area where Sprite demonstrates sprite transparency.

When all layers sport transparent pixel for particular position, the resulting combination
should be "transparency fallback" colour, which is set to "pink $E3" - to be displayed
in result as pink.


Why/how 24 combinations
=======================

Sprite has three states: "sprite pixel" and "transparent pixel", "no pixel"

Layer2 has four states: "pixel", "pixel w/ priority", "transparent", "transparent w/ p."

ULA-HiRes has two states: "pixel", "transparent"

That allows for 24 combinations (3 * 4 * 2 = 24). The order is selected by the control
register and by priority bit of L2 colour, but there's only single possible order for
every state combination, so order is not contributing to total amount of possibilities.

(the "no pixel" states are actually possible also with L2 and ULA layers, if clip-window
is used to cut part of layer out, or L2 is completely disabled ... for the sake of finite
amount of combinations in the test, these possibilities are ignored)

Now if the states are named {ss, sT, sX} for Sprites, {ll, pp, lT, pT} for Layer2 and
{uu, uT} for ULA layer, for the "SLU" layer ordering these 24 combinations are possible:

; "xxyyzz" three states contributing to final pixel, "xx" after is visible result, where
; "TT" is result for no visible pixel (transparency-fallback-colour register will display)

The results for other layer ordering are left out as an exercise for dear reader... :)
