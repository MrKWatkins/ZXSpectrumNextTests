TODO: zmakebas to build +3DOS bas file directly?

Test ideas:

base:
 - DMA
 - EI keeps interrupt disabled for next instruction test

* Palettes:
 - CSpect seems to render 9b colours $B600/$B601 weird, the blue value seems shifted in either case.
 - exercise all ways to upload/download + autoincrement on/off (layer2 + auto-inc + 9b = bug in .27)
 - exercise ink masks / borders

* Layer2:
 . "hidden" SRAM access under Bank 5 and 1/2 Bank 7 (hidden by FPGA BRAM redirection)

* LoRes:
 - scroll (vs ULA, half-pixel precision)
 - enable overrides ulanext on/off
 - ULAplus Radastan original 4bpp mode (or what it is)

* Timex 8x1 colour

* Timex 512x192 hires

* Sprites:
 - NextReg mirrors
 - core3 limits (128 sprites, 64 patterns)
 - exhausting pixel throughput on single line

* Copper:
 - writing code on fly, changing index while keeping mode, etc..

("." points are optional, more like examples/documenting current ZXN board, than trying
to preserve those features for future ... "-" points are like serious tests where emulator
is expected to follow the behaviour, if it wants to be accurate)
