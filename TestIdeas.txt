Test ideas:

base:
 - DMA

* Palettes:
 - CSpect seems to render 9b colours $B600/$B601 weird, the blue value seems shifted in either case.
 - exercise all ways to upload/download + autoincrement on/off
 - exercise ink masks / borders

* Layer2:
 . RAM positioning quirks (and 128K shadow quirks) (quirk = switching off L2/wrong content)

* LoRes:
 - scroll (vs ULA, half-pixel precision)
 - enable overrides ulanext on/off

* Timex 8x1 colour

* Timex 512x192 hires

* Sprites:
 - exercise old stuff (core 1.xx)
 - NextReg mirrors
 - 4-bit graphics
 - palette offsets
 - mirror/rotation
 - scaling
 - exhausting pixel throughput on single line
 - order flip
 - syncing with scanline while multiplexing

("." points are optional, more like examples/documenting current ZXN board, than trying
to preserve those features for future ... "-" points are like serious tests where emulator
is expected to follow the behaviour, if it wants to be accurate)
