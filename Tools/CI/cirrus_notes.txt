My notes about experiments done:

so I managed to create local docker image configured by Dockerfile, which is gcc:6
image as base, cloning Next variant of sjasmplus from github, compiling + installing
it inside the new image (gcc+sjasmplus docker image).

Building local docker image:
    docker build -t ped7g/gcc/sjasmplus Tools/CI/

Running build-all shell script with the docker container:
    docker run --rm -v ~/zx/ZXNextTests/fork-MrKW/:/zzz -w /zzz -t ped7g/gcc/sjasmplus:latest ./buildTests.sh

It maps project directory into "/zzz" inside container instance and runs "buildTests.sh"
with the compiled sjasmplus - the resulting SNA files are written into real FS, visible
on host system too! (i.e. malicious/buggy script may damage host files, which are visible
within the mapping)

After the Dockerfile was ready, the Cirrus CI configuration was done, it's in ".cirrus.yml"
file, in the project-root. The only task is to build all tests with that custom docker
container.

TODO:

DONE:
* Verify failure in build will show up in the commit on github
  = WORKS
* try to squeeze allocated resources for CI instance further (1 CPU + 600M RAM was first try and works)
  = 300M did work but git clone took 3s instead of 1s (may have been also temporary hickup),
  so I decided to go with 400M as current "final" setting (seems to work well)
* Add verification of snapshot filenames (8.3 with .sna extension, no duplicity!)
  = done
* redirect sjasmplus repository to my own fork to have control about releases
  = done, also only specific TAG is now cloned, to upgrade the assembler in controlled way
* verify there is simple way to trigger docker image build when sjasmplus sources change (it's cached)
  = done
